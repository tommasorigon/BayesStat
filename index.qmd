Bayesian Statistics is a PhD course organized in three modules, which are:

- Introduction to Bayesian statistics (xxh),  -- Bernardo Nipoti
- [Bayesian computations](https://tommasorigon.github.io/CompStat/)  (12h) -- Tommaso Rigon
- Bayesian modelling (xx h) -- Raffaele Argiento

<!-- ## Prerequisites -->

<!-- It is assumed the knowledge of the following topics: -->

<!--   * Fundamentals of Bayesian statistics. Refer to Chapters 1-5 of Hoff (2009). -->
<!--   * Monte Carlo integration. Refer to Chapter 3 of Robert and Casella (2009), or Chapter 4 of Hoff (2009). -->

<!--    Further preliminary material is available (in Italian) at the website of the course [R for the multivariate statistical analysis](https://tommasorigon.github.io/introR/).  -->

## Detailed syllabus

* Something something

## Examination

The exam rules are explained [here](exam_rules.pdf). In short, you will be asked to read a paper, write a short review paper about it, and finally make a presentation. An example from previous years:

- [Paper](AOAP2018.pdf) assigned to a PhD student, using the keyword system;
- [Short review](ghilotti_review.pdf), written using the Bayesian Analysis template;
- [Slides](ghilotti_slides.pdf) of the final presentation.
